### A day trip to Neuschwanstein & Hohenschwangau our Munich get‑away treat

We booked the day trip through a tour platform (GetYourGuide), and from the very start everything ran smoothly: pick up from central Munich was on time, and the coach was comfortable enough for the 2‑ish hour ride. I grabbed a coffee and a croissant before boarding a simple start that became part of the vibe for the day: relaxed but excited.

### 🚍 The journey & arrival  

The drive out of Munich was peaceful enough, giving time to chat, look out of the window, and get into holiday mode. When we arrived at the base near the castles, the air already felt different alpine, crisp, and quietly expectant.  

Our guide, **Mark**, was excellent. Friendly, informative, and clearly passionate about the region’s history. He set the tone from the start: not just a photo stop, but a real story about kings, art, ambition, and the dramatic vision behind Neuschwanstein.

### 🏰 Neuschwanstein & the walk to Mary’s Bridge  

Approaching Mary's Bridge the famous vantage point for castle photos was a bit of a hike. The path is fairly steep in sections, and there was a fair climb involved. I won’t lie: after a few late nights in Munich I was feeling a bit groggy. But I’m glad we pushed on the views from the bridge made every step worth it. The famous towers of Neuschwanstein rising out of the forest, framed by Bavaria’s mountains and sky it’s exactly the kind of “post‑card moment” that photos don’t really do justice to.

We passed other tourists coming up by coach or even horse and carriage; doing it on foot felt more satisfying and less “tourist bus shuffle.” It also meant we got a bit of peace at the bridge before it got too crowded.

### 🏰 Hohenschwangau Castle & Alpine Lake  

As part of the tour we also visited Hohenschwangau Castle, the childhood home of King Ludwig II, which sits near a beautiful lake. The contrast between the romantic, storybook fantasy of Neuschwanstein and the more traditional, historic charm of Hohenschwangau gave the day a nice balance.  

We also took in views of a nearby mountain lake (Alpsee) calm water, mountains, reflections, and the kind of quiet beauty that feels like a deep breath after the walking and sightseeing.

### 🏛️ Inside the castles & the guided tour experience  

The castle tour itself was impressive the interiors, the architecture, the history all delivered with clarity and care by our guide. It was a **fully guided room‑by‑room tour** (as is standard): you don’t just wander freely, but you move as a group under supervision. This means you don’t get to linger forever in any one room, but the trade off is that you get to see many carefully restored historical rooms and hear context and stories that make them come alive.  

Yes the tour felt a bit short, and some moments you might wish for more time. But the scale, the detail, and the sense of atmosphere more than make up for it.  

### 😊 My Verdict  

I started the day skeptical tired, not sure I really had the energy for a full on castle hop after tracking all over Munich the day before on top of a 4am set off to the airport, and not expecting much more than a tourist photo opportunity.  

Instead I came away with a sense of wonder, a camera full of unforgettable views, and a story of a fairytale castle day well worth getting up early for.  

If you’re in Munich and fancy a day out that mixes nature, history, architecture, and a bit of light hiking get yourself on a trip to Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. Morning coffee, a bit of a climb, castle grandeur and a lakeside stroll: it’s exactly the kind of spontaneous adventure that leaves you thinking, “I’m really glad we did that.”
