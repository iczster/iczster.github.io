## Hiking to Skiddaw Summit & Little Man

**Overview**

Parking isnt great and you need to arrive early to have any chance of a parking space (the car park is small). Otherwise this was a fantastic hike with great views. We even managed to experience a cloud inversion. 

After some early clag this cleared and its a pretty steep and brutal ascent. We took in Skiddaw little man also and recommend you tackle this afer summitting. 

### Key Hike Points

* Steep but rewarding ascent  
* Cloud inversion at the summit
* Claggy start 
* Limited parking (arrive early) 

### Quote from the Hike
