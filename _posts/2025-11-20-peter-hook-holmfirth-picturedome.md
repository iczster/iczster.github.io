### Peter Hook and The Light – Picturedrome, Holmfirth – Thursday, November 20th

Thursday night at the Picturedrome in Holmfirth was a bittersweet celebration of post-punk classics as Peter Hook and The Light delivered a spellbinding performance. The crowd, buzzing with excitement, filled the intimate venue with energy from the moment Hooky and the band took the stage. Fans old and new swayed and sang along to every note, creating an electric and communal atmosphere.

The setlist was a masterclass in nostalgia, opening with the punchy “Get Ready” followed by “Crystal” (New Order cover) and “60 Miles an Hour”, immediately getting the crowd moving. “Turn My Way”, “Vicious Streak”, and “Primitive Notion” kept the momentum high, while “Slow Jam”, “Rock the Shack”, and “Someone Like You” showcased Hooky’s knack for blending energy with melancholy. Mid-set tracks like “Close Range”, “Run Wild”, “Brutal”, and “Here to Stay” reminded everyone why New Order’s catalog remains timeless.

The night was tinged with sorrow, however. Earlier in the day, news broke of the passing of Mani from The Stone Roses, and the mood of the audience shifted. Hooky paused to dedicate “Atmosphere” (Joy Division cover) to Mani, a moment of reflection that brought both grief and unity to the room. Following this, the band played “Dead Souls”, “New Dawn Fades”, “From Safety to Where...?”, “These Days”, and “She's Lost Control”, each song soaked in poignant emotion yet performed with the precision and energy that kept the crowd entranced.

The concert then surged forward with “Shadowplay”, “Wilderness”, “Digital”, and “Transmission”, before closing the Joy Division portion with a stirring “Love Will Tear Us Apart”. Transitioning back to New Order, fans were treated to “Your Silent Face”, “Procession”, “Ceremony”, “Regret”, “Run”, “Bizarre Love Triangle”, and “Temptation” every note met with loud sing-alongs and cheers, cementing the night as both celebratory and cathartic.

From the pulsating basslines to the audience’s enthusiastic participation, Peter Hook and The Light offered a night of musical brilliance and heartfelt emotion fitting tribute not only to the legacy of Joy Division and New Order but also to the power of live music to unite people, even in moments of mourning.

**Highlights:**

* Crowd interaction and sing-alongs throughout the set apart from one guy who was dropping his guts all night. Not impressed.
*  Heartfelt dedication of Atmosphere to Mani
* Seamless mix of New Order and Joy Division classics in original order
* Emotional yet celebratory atmosphere

```A night to remember in Holmfirth.```
