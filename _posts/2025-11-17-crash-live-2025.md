The **CRASH Live 2025** event took place on the **15th and 16th November 2025**, hosted at the Holiday Inn in Kenilworth, Warwickshire and what a weekend it turned out to be.

## Battling the Storms to Get There

The journey down was *not* for the faint-hearted.  
After a night of relentless storms, flooded roads, and detours that felt like bonus levels from a lost 8-bit adventure game, getting to the venue became an achievement in itself. But arriving at the hotel, greeted by fellow retro enthusiasts, made the effort instantly worthwhile. The banging breakfast went down well and it soon become clear the place reeked of geek 😂

## ZX Spectrum Next & Gremlin Graphics Sessions

One of the biggest highlights of the weekend was spending time with the **Spectrum Next team**.  
Hearing about the continuing development of the Next, upcoming games, and seeing the passion behind the project was brilliant.

Equally memorable were the sessions with **Gremlin Graphics** legendary developers whose games shaped so many childhoods. Their talks, stories, and behind-the-scenes insights added a real warmth and depth to the event. It ended all too soon though and felt it would have been better moving the discussion forward after a bit of waffle and technical hitches.

## Arcade Machines, Pinball & Pure Nostalgia

Of course, no retro event is complete without the glow and hum of classic arcade machines.

I had great fun reliving old battles on:

- **Star Wars** (vector glory never gets old)
- **Galaxian** (I got farmed the less said about that the better)
- A bit of **pinball** to round things off

There’s something special about crowding around an arcade cab with people who love it just as much as you do.

## A Perfect Weekend (Plus Curry & Boxing)

Saturday ended with an excellent curry the perfect fuel after a day of gaming, chatting, and exploring.  

I made it back just in time to catch the **Benn vs Eubank** fight, rounding off a packed but fantastic day.

## Final Thoughts

CRASH Live 2025 delivered exactly what you’d hope for from a retro gaming event:  
**community, nostalgia, great conversations, and great games.**

A brilliant weekend, and one I’m already looking forward to returning to next year.
