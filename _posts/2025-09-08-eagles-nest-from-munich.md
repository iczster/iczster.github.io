## 🚌 The Tour: Early Start & Easy Pickup

We arranged this trip through **GetYourGuide**, with an early **8am pickup from the centre of Munich**. It was an easy, well organised start that set the tone for what turned into an unforgettable day. A sneakly latte and croissant got the day off to a flyer. On the way out Ursula also took us on the route to pass some historical places like the police station were Hitler lived over.


## 👩 Our Guide: Ursula

A **special mention to Ursula**, our guide, who absolutely made the day. Warm, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable, she had a real passion for the region’s history and geography.

She wasn’t just reciting a script she told stories, gave context, and answered every question we threw at her.

## 🏔️ The Journey Up: Lunch & Mountain Roads

We stopped for lunch with **beautiful views of the Bavarian Alps** before boarding a bus to the summit.

What struck me almost immediately was the combination of **breathtaking natural beauty** and the weight of history. You can understand why this location was chosen, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. The Eagle’s Nest remains a **remarkable feat of engineering**, built with immense effort and cost.

The engineering behind the road is astonishing: carved into the mountain with **only small passing points for coaches**, and run with **military precision** buses depart to the minute.

But there’s no ignoring the human cost of its construction, carried out under extreme pressure and danger.

## 🚇 The Tunnel & Lift: Strange Atmosphere

The **cold, dank tunnel** leading to the brass lift had a distinctly eerie feeling. Walking through it was like stepping back in time.

The **lift ride to the top** didn’t help with that sense of unease a surreal, silent ascent to one of the most stunning viewpoints I’ve ever seen.

## 🌄 At the Summit: Views & A Rare Sight

The summit itself is **beyond breathtaking**. We walked over to the cross and, amazingly, spotted a **rare Edelweiss flower** on the way. Ursula was genuinely shocked a real highlight.

We chose to **walk down** from the Eagle’s Nest, a leisurely 20 minute descent, before catching the bus.

## 🏛️ The Museum & Berghof Site

We visited the museum, which is full of powerful, detailed information. You could spend **hours there** and still not see everything.

Afterwards, Ursula guided us to the **site of Hitler’s Berghof**, where today only the **retaining wall and fragments of concrete** remain. Standing there, with the Alps behind, felt surreal and heavy.

## 📸 The Journey Back

On the way home, we stopped for a couple of photo opportunities overlooking the Alps. A great way to decompress after such a full, emotional day.

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

I’ve always had a real interest in this period of history, and the Eagle’s Nest was a place I’ve wanted to visit for a long time.

I **loved every minute** the views, the history, the weirdness, the engineering, and the emotional weight of the place.

A day I’ll never forget.
