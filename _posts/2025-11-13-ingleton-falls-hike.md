## Ingleton Falls Hike (Fierce Storm Waterfalls)

We tackled the always-awesome **Ingleton Waterfalls Trail** just a day after **Storm Claudia**, and it completely transformed the experience.  

The waterfalls were absolutely **roaring** the most powerful I’ve ever seen them. The trail started out dry enough, but by the halfway point the skies opened and we got **soaked**. Classic Yorkshire weather.

A couple of changes on the route stood out:

- The once reliable **ice-cream van is no longer there**.  
- However, there’s now a **small kiosk** by the caravan park that does drinks and snacks, which was a welcome surprise.
- We got to see a rainbow over the fells

As always, the scenery was stunning with lush greens, dramatic gorges, and fast flowing rivers everywhere. The trail was noticeably **quiet**, probably because the entry fee has now gone up to **£11 per person**, which is, well, a bit steep.

We wrapped up with a much needed **coffee and a seriously good slice of carrot cake** at a café in Ingleton. Proper reward after a rain battered loop.

Still one of the best circular walks in Yorkshire. Fierce falls, wet boots, rainbows, great cake. Ideal.
