# 🎸 A Tribute to Manchester Manchester Academy

Manchester is a city that breathes music. Its bands, venues and stories are woven into the cultural DNA not just of the city but of entire generations. On Friday 5th December, Manchester Academy hosted a night dedicated to that legacy a celebration of the artists who shaped a sound, defined an era and still soundtrack our lives today.  

This wasn’t just a gig it was a nostalgia trip, a reunion, and at times, a wake for a fallen hero. It was loud, chaotic, brilliant, imperfect and emotional – in other words, exactly what Manchester music should be.

## 🌧️ The Smiths Melancholy and Majesty

The night opened with a tribute to *The Smiths*, and from the first shimmering chords of **"How Soon Is Now"**, the place erupted.  

Not afraid to poke fun of themselves with lines like "Welcome to the best pantomime in Manchester"

The band captured the signature blend of jangly guitars, introspective melancholy and kitchen sink drama that makes The Smiths feel timeless.  

Hearing **"Bigmouth Strikes Again"** in a packed room of people singing like their teenage years depended on it was properly epic.  

The frontman didn’t try to “be” Morrissey he channelled him just enough to evoke that weird mix of swagger and vulnerability.  

It was a reminder that before the headlines, the essays and the Twitter wars, The Smiths were just four lads making music that hit harder than anything else around.

## 🧊 Oasish Swagger, Snarl and Singalongs

Next up were **Oasish**, possibly the best-named tribute act on the circuit.  

As soon as they launched into **"Rock ’n’ Roll Star"**, the crowd shifted gear. Pints were raised, arms went up, and the floor became a mass of bouncing silhouettes.  

The Liam Gallagher impression was uncanny wiry stance, hands behind back, nasal bite on every syllable.  

The attitude was there too:  
not panto Gallagher, but properly dialled in.  

Oasis tribute bands are ten a penny, but these lads were tight, loud and unapologetically fun.  

For a brief moment, you could close your eyes and pretend it was 1995 again.

## 🌹 The Clone Roses Emotion, Energy and a Tribute to Mani

Then came the headliner **The Clone Roses** who turned an already great night into something genuinely special.  

With the recent passing of **Mani**, a legend of both *The Stone Roses* and *Primal Scream*, the atmosphere shifted.  

For many of us, Mani wasn’t just a bassist he was the backbone of the music we grew up with, the groove that lived in our bones.

There was a real sense that he should have been there DJing alongside **Dave Sweetmore**, taking the piss, smiling, buzzing off the crowd.  

Instead, he became the emotional centre of the night.  

Tracks like **"Made of Stone"** and **"Sally Cinnamon"** were sung with reverence, joy and sadness all at once with **Mersey Paradise** being dedicated to Mani (his favourite track)

But it was **"I Am the Resurrection"** that broke and healed the room in equal measure.  

That iconic build, the release, the beautiful chaos you could feel people letting go, remembering gigs, nights out ,friendships, youth.

It wasn’t just a cover.  
It was catharsis.

## 🎧 Afterparty Club Academy Chaos

As if three hours of wall-to-wall classics wasn’t enough, the night rolled on to **Club Academy** for the afterparty.  

Fresh from playing a gig at **Warrington Parr Hall**, **Clint Boon** joined **Dave Sweetmore** behind the decks and the energy went off all over again.  

House, indie, baggy, Britpop the soundtrack of nights that turned into mornings.  

By this point:  
- voices were gone  
- heads were sore (Im not known for my drinking prowess) 
- drinks had been spilled  
- and inhibitions were a distant memory  

It was messy, loud (too loud couldnt hear yourself speak) and absolutely brilliant.

## 🍻 Final Thoughts Headaches and Heartbeats

We left with **sore heads, hoarse voices and full hearts**.  

Tribute nights can be hit or miss but this one wasn’t trying to replace the real thing.  

It was paying respect to a city’s musical heritage, and to one of its greatest sons.  

Manchester isn’t just a music scene.  
It’s a community.  
A history.  
A legacy built on attitude, humour, tragedy and genius.  

And on nights like this, you realise that **the songs aren’t just memories they’re markers of who we are, where we’ve been, and who we’ve lost along the way**.  

Rest in peace, Mani.  
Thanks for the music.

*Until next time, Manchester. Keep the tunes loud and the pints cold.*
