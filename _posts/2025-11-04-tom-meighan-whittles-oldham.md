### Review

The small downstairs room at Whittles Tokyo Project in Oldham offered a modest, almost intimate setting for Tom Meighan’s return to the town. On a quiet Tuesday night, with only a modest turnout by his standards, the gig didn’t carry the energy of a large festival or arena show; instead it felt personal, lean and stripped-back.

The evening opened with support from Aziz Ibrahim. His set, while uncertain in front of a sparse crowd, had some strong moments, a  few standout guitar lines and a rawness in tone that hinted at what might be possible under fuller attendance. Aziz’s performance warmed up the space, but it was clear many in the room were there mainly for the headliner.

When Tom finally took the stage, there was a certain warmth in his presence. He moved through a mixture of his solo material and classic songs from his former band’s catalogue. The performance included new tracks perhaps less familiar to the small crowd but when he hit the old stand-bys people responded. His voice remained powerful, and a familiar track like “Club Foot” drew the biggest reaction of the night. The energy was modest but genuine: the crowd sang along, and there was a sense of loyalty and nostalgia in the room.

That said the show had its compromises. The sparse venue meant that even the biggest vocals and riffs lacked the “stadium” weight they once had. Some newer solo songs didn’t land as strongly. And while Tom’s charisma still carries, there was a feeling the gig wasn’t quite able to convert the intimacy of the setting into a fully charged rock show. This was an acoustic set afterall so nobody was surprised or disapointed.

A middling but honest performance. As a modest, local level gig it delivered heartfelt, stripped-back renditions of both old favourites and newer efforts. Tom Meighan still has the stage presence; Aziz Ibrahim added a solid if under attended warmup. For longtime fans it was a chance to reconnect, but for newcomers the show may have lacked the spark to turn them into converts.

### pros:
  - Intimate atmosphere, close proximity to artist  
  - Strong vocal performance from Tom Meighan  
  - Nostalgic hits landed well “Club Foot” stood out  
  - Support from Aziz Ibrahim added variety  

### cons:
  - Sparse crowd diluted full impact  
  - Some newer solo songs felt under developed live  
  - Venue size limited energy, lacked rock show punch  
  - Set felt somewhat conservative, with fewer surprises  

### Summary: 
  On a quiet Tuesday in Oldham, Tom Meighan’s gig at Whittles was far from his glory days but it remained a worthwhile experience for fans seeking a low key, genuine performance. If you’re after big production or raw rock power, this wasn’t the show for you. But for anyone loyal to his voice and catalogue, it still delivered some honest moments. A solid, sold out and modest return rather than  an all blazing comeback to Oldham. The previous visit being at the Castle (now gone) in 2009.
