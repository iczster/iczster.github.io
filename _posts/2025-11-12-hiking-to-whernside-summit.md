### 🏔️ Hiking to the Top of Whernside  
Whernside is the tallest of the **Yorkshire Three Peaks**, and although it’s often called the gentler giant, the weather on this trip decided otherwise, still in the midst of a storm so we got lucky. We began at the mighty **Ribblehead Viaduct**, an iconic and dramatic starting point.

Only a short way into the route, we reached a stunning **waterfall section** a perfect early highlight before the long, steady ridge climb.

### ✈️ A400 Flyover A Standout Moment  
Not long after passing the waterfall, a deep rumble echoed through the mist. Moments later, an **A400 military aircraft** burst through the cloud line, sweeping low across the ridge and banking directly above us.

It felt like an unplanned, private airshow just for the us and the only other 2 hikers on the mountain that morning.

### 🌫️ Mist, Cold and Zero Views at the Summit  
As we climbed higher, conditions worsened:

- Visibility dropped to just a few metres  
- Temperatures fell sharply  
- Wind whipped across the summit path  

At the top, Whernside gave us *no views whatsoever*, just a ghostly, atmospheric summit shelter where we ate our packed lunch before quickly moving on.

### ⬇️ Steep Descent to the Farmland  
The descent down Whernside’s eastern flank is steep and rocky, and the knees definitely feel it. Eventually, the trail eases into rolling **fields and farmland**, guiding us back towards the Ribblehead Viaduct rising out of the mist.

### ☕ The Perfect Finish – Coffee & Bakewell Slice  
We wrapped up the day at the **Station Inn**, warming up with coffee and an absolutely **banging bakewell slice** the ideal finish after a cold, misty hike.
