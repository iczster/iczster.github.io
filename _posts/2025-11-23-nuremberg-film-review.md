📘 Plot Summary

The film focuses on the true story of the psychological duel between US Army psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek) and the imprisoned Nazi leader Hermann Göring (Russell Crowe) during the first Nuremberg trial in 1945-1946. As the Allies attempt to hold the Nazi regime accountable for the Holocaust, Kelley works to understand the depths of their evil. 

Despite arriving late and missing the first five or so minutes (or, let’s be honest, maybe twenty 😅), Nuremberg still pulled me straight into its world and held my attention all the way through its long, deliberate runtime.

For a film built around dialogue, interrogation, and courtroom strategy, it’s far more engaging and cinematic than it has any right to be. The pacing is controlled and patient, yet the characters and stakes are so sharply drawn that even the quieter moments carry real weight. If anything, missing the opening only highlighted how confidently the film establishes itself  within minutes I understood the tone, the world, and where the story was headed.

⭐ Russell Crowe Steals the Film

Russell Crowe delivers one of his strongest performances in years.

He plays his role with a calm authority that anchors the entire plot. Crowe’s presence adds gravity to the tribunal scenes and emotional depth to the moral dilemmas the film tackles. In a story filled with historical detail and legal intricacy, he brings a human pulse that carries the film forward.

He grounds the narrative, brings focus to complex moments, and ultimately serves as the emotional centrepiece of the movie which is probably why it remained so captivating even after a chaotic late arrival.

🎥 Final Thoughts

Nuremberg is a long film, but it earns every minute. The mood, pacing, and performances (especially Crowe’s) make it absorbing from start to finish. Even jumping in slightly late didn’t diminish its impact, if anything, it highlighted how clear, confident, and commanding the storytelling is.

If you enjoy historical dramas, courtroom tension, or performance-led cinema, which I do then this one is absolutely worth your time.
